Should work fine in Firefox and Chrome  

### About

I started reading the platformer chapter of EJS but got immediately sidetracked  
into making this tool since working with level strings in a regular text editor  
is very inconvenient.  

It provides some very basic text-based grid editing functionality  
and allows you to save your work or open an existing level   
via copy/paste.

Can easily be configured to work with the electronic life project from  
the 2nd edition of EJS or with any other simple char grid project by altering  
the `PALETTE` constant.
