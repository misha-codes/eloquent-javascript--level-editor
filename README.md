## eloquent-javascript--level-editor
*a level editor for the Eloquent JavaScript platformer project*

You can try it out at: https://misha-codes.github.io/eloquent-javascript--level-editor/

Should work fine in Firefox and Chrome  

### About

I started reading the platformer chapter of EJS but got immediately sidetracked  
into making this tool since making your own levels is fun, but working with  
level strings in a regular text editor is absolutely not.  

It provides some very basic text-based grid editing functionality  
and allows you to save your work or open an existing level   
through copy/pasting.

Can easily be configured to work with the electronic life project from  
the 2nd edition of EJS or with any other simple char grid project by altering  
the `PALETTE` constant and some minor customization of the color-scheme-related  
code.
